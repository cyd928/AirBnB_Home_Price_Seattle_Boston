### 1. Installations
---------------------
* Data Wrangling tools: _numpy, pandas_
* Visualisation tools: _matplotlib, seaborn, plotly_
* Modelling tools: _sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.ensemble_


### 2. Project Motivation
--------------------------
As AirBnB housing data is open-source, it would be interesting to acquire the large sets of messy data to understand the story behind the rented homes. Using datasets from Seattle and Boston, I would like to seek the answers for three questions:
* How does home price changes overtime in Seattle and Boston?
* What property characteristics are associated to AirBnB home price?
* Can AirBnB home price be predicted using a machine learning model?


### 3. File Descriptions
-------------------------
The _AirBnB_price_prediction.ipynb_ file contains the data wrangling, visualisation and modelling processes as well as demonstrating the results. The comments in addition to the code will also help you follow the steps and understand the analysis.
